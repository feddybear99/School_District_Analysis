# School_District_Analysis
Summary below explains the results from my School_District_Analysis and how it compares with the results from the module.

*Overview of the school district analysis*

The purpose of this project is to help Maria analyze data on student funding and students' standardized test scores. data for analysis, reporting, and presentation for an entire School District to provide insights about performance, trends, and patterns. Our task is to aggregate the data and showcase trends in school performance. This analysis will help the school board and superintendent in making decisions regarding the school budgets and priorities. 
The School Board has asked Maria to re-analyze some data because there appears to be some anomalies in the data, in particular, math and reading scores of the 9th grade students from Thomas High School. Our analysis below will compare and contrast the Original version vs. Thomas High School version to find potential errors.

Outcome: There was not a large impact on adding NaNs to Thomas High School's 9th graders because there are only 461 students in 9th grade at Thomas High School, and given the total student count is 39,170, both math and reading scores were only off by a couple hundreths of a percent as a margin of error.
